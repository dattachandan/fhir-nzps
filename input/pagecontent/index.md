# FHIR NZ IPS

This FHIR implementation guide (IG) defines the draft FHIR translation of the [HISO 10099:2022 NZ International Patient Summary (NZIPS) standard](https://consult.health.govt.nz/hiso/hiso-10099-2022-nzips/supporting_documents/hiso10099nzipsdraft20220509.pdf) published for consultation in May & July 2022. 

The mahi to develop HISO 10099:2022 NZIPS standard has been guided by an expert advisory group and industry special interest group, comprising health
professionals, software experts and consumer representatives who have worked with HISO since October 2021 to review drafts and
provide input. The specification is now open to everyone for comment.

## About the draft standard

NZIPS is a deliverable of the [Interoperability Roadmap 2020](https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/hiso-100832020-interoperability-roadmap) and a standard that will contribute to a more joined-up and equitable health system. NZIPS is our adaptation for Aotearoa of the recognised ISO and HL7® International Patient Summary (IPS) standards. 

The Global Digital Health Partnership endorses the IPS and promotes its adoption by member countries, including New Zealand, as a pivotal standard for interoperability at national level and globally. 

NZIPS tailors the IPS to New Zealand data standards and use case requirements.

NZIPS is principally a standard for the makeup and exchange of a defined core personal health data set. In its first iteration, NZIPS
covers the person’s health conditions, immunisations, medicines, allergies and adverse reactions, measurements and vital signs, and
test results.

The standard comprises a data set specification and related data exchange and data portability requirements. The standard provides
a source of requirements for continuity of care, consumer access and patient record transfer use cases, defining the key data
elements and how they are represented. The standard encompasses a developing profile of the HL7® FHIR® IPS Implementation
Guide, based on these choices. NZIPS also defines underpinnings of the future Hira information model.
